        Timing will end differently based on the gamemode:
        <ol>
            <li>If it is a "Beat Ganon" seed, standard timing rules apply; .done is on the first frame of the cutscene that plays after beating Ganon.</li>
            <li>If it is a "Triforce Hunt" seed, .done will be on the first frame the game fades completely to black after obtaining the last required piece.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
